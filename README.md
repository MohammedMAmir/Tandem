# Tandem – "Side by side, even miles apart."

## Concept & Meaning
In dance, tandem movement is about two partners moving in harmony—whether side by side, mirroring, or following one another’s lead. It’s an elegant push and pull, a silent understanding, where each step feels effortless because it’s taken together. This app embodies that rhythm, helping long-distance couples stay in sync through shared notes, lists, memories, and plans, no matter the miles between them.


## Features Aligned with the Name
- Tandem Notes – A shared space for love letters, little thoughts, and inside jokes.
- Tandem Lists – A way to coordinate your next steps—whether it's a shared bucket list or daily to-dos.
- Tandem Vault – A private collection of cherished memories, photos, and voice notes.
- Tandem Calendar – A synchronized schedule for video calls, future visits, and anniversaries.


## Design Aesthetic
- Flowing, graceful UI animations, like a waltz or tango, emphasizing smooth transitions.
- A subtle, rhythmic design—soft curves, motion accents, and warm, inviting colors like deep reds, golden ambers, or soft lavenders.
- Mirroring elements—a dual interface where both partners’ inputs feel intertwined, like two dancers anticipating each other’s next move.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
