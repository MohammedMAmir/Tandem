# Tandem – "Side by side, even miles apart."

## Concept & Meaning
In dance, tandem movement is about two partners moving in harmony—whether side by side, mirroring, or following one another’s lead. It’s an elegant push and pull, a silent understanding, where each step feels effortless because it’s taken together. This app embodies that rhythm, helping long-distance couples stay in sync through shared notes, lists, memories, and plans, no matter the miles between them.
